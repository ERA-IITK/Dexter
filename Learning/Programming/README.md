# Programming Learning Tasks 
## Programming in C++ , Python (22/04/21 - 03/05/21)
- These tasks are aimed at giving you necessary programming skills to succeed in the project.
- There are two levels of tasks, depending on your current level of familiarity with programming languages.

### Instructions
- You can use online IDEs (like those provided by Hacker Rank), or online Jupyter notebooks (like those provided by Google Colab) as your development environment.
- If you are comfortable with your local setup, feel free to use that.

### 1. Programming in C++ (22/04/21 - 27/04/21 )

1. Binary Trees
2. Red Black Trees
3. Graph Representation using Adjacency Lists and Adjacency Matrix
